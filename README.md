# A Better City Android App

## Description
Mobile app for android. A mobile app for publishing city problems, allowing public services to respond to them (reserving to the solution and publishing the solution) and making a decision based on the popularity of the problem (likes from users). The controlling services will also have access to statistics, on the basis of which they will be able to make an assessment of the quality of public services.

## Technical notes
The app uses Firebase and Google Services, so you need to add the google-services.json file to the root of the project (was deleted for security reasons), as well as in AndroidManifest.xml com.google.android.geo.API_KEY

## Disclamore!
This was the first time I worked with Kotlin and Android development. It was also short on time.
